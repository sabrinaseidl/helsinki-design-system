Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The HDS kit contains all the resources you need to get started.
  
Create impactful services  
In the future, Helsinki will be better known for its influential people, acts and encounters. Our attitude ”One Hel of an impact” challenges you to think big, and encourages you to carry out exceptional deeds. This gives you the opportunity to make Helsinki to stand out from other cities. Helsinki is a place where you can make a difference for the good of the whole world, with people who are passionate about making a difference.
  
The cornerstones for creating visually impactful services with the City of Helsinki brand are   
- Logo  
- Font  
- Colors  
- Recognizable graphic elements, like Koros  
- Photography

The Helsinki Design system  
The Master libraries of 'Helsinki Design System' are the single point of reference for your design. When you connect your design files with the design system libraries, you can use ready designed components and have them synced whenever the design system is updated.



## Tools    

Workflow with Sketch + Abstract:

Sketch is a vector graphics editor and is widely adopted by designers across the globe to create user interface designs for web and mobile services.   
  
Abstract enables designers to reliably version and manage their Sketch files. By leveraging and extends the technology of Git, Abstract provides design teams with a lightweight workflow and stable tools so designers can work together with confidence.   
  
  
## Setting up

You will need to install Sketch and Abstract software.  
  
To edit Sketch design files in Abstract, you’ll need to download the Sketch software (link here) and the Abstract software (link here). Even though Abstract has a web application, It’s not possible to edit or create Sketch files with it. It is possible for your team members to view your designs and provide feedback.
  
Install fonts  
Make sure that you have the Helsinki Grotesk font installed.  
(instructions here about how to acquire the font?)  
  
Create a project in Abstract  
You either need permission rights to create a new project in City of Helsinki organization, or you need an invite to a created project in this organization.  
(image ‘Abstract - create new project’)  
(Details about the permission rights here?)  

Create a Sketch file  
Once you’ve opened a project, click “Master” on the left sidebar and choose “Add file > Create Sketch File” from the view that open on the right. Now you can enter a name for the new Sketch file.   
(image ‘Abstract - create new file’)  
  
We name all files following the below naming convention:  
  
(Naming protocol?)
Example 1: 
Example 2: 
  
Once finished, click “Create Sketch File.” Your new Sketch file will now appear in the Files List of Abstract.  
  
Once you have created your Sketch file in Abstract, always open your design file straight from Abstract. This way, all changes made to your file will be tracked and you have a version control over it.  
  
Link the design system libraries to your design file   
(pictures here?)
  
Open up any Branch within an Abstract Project and select the Files tab  
Select Add File -> “Link Library…”  
Select the Helsinki Design System project  
Select one or multiple Libraries and click “Link Libraries”  
  
  
Once you link the Design System Library to your Project, your components are kept in sync with the Master library. When changes are made to the Master Library, you’ll have the option to update your symbols from Master via an alert in the top right for proper version control.

### Using library components  

HDS components and icons live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.  
(image ‘Helsinki Design System - Master files’)  
  
Library menu navigation  
There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.  
From the Insert menu, select Symbols → HDS [component name] to add symbols onto your page.  
(image ‘Component - Text field - insert’)  
Helsinki Design System symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.  
  
Structure of the symbols (library components)  
Symbols are organised by component; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.
To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your Artboard. (see image above)
((For even more configurability, use the individual building blocks found under the Items folder within the symbol. Be sure your custom design adheres to our design guidelines.))  
  
Text styles  
(image ‘Typography - header - insert’ and ‘Typography - body - insert’)  
  
Library menu navigation  
From the main menu select Insert → Text Styles → HDS Typography to insert a text style.  
Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.
